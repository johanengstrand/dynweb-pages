                    <h2>Summary of our thesis</h2>
                    <p>
                        Usage of class D audio amplifiers has become increasingly widespread in recent years, mainly due to their high efficiency,
                        which can reach almost 100 %. Class D amplifiers can also be compact, making them suitable for mobile
                        applications. In contrast, the most efficient conventional amplifiers such as class B can reach a
                        maximum efficiency of 78.5 %. The high efficiency of class D amplifiers can be attributed to the
                        switching stage, which in the case of a half-bridge design consists of two amplifying MOSFETs. These
                        MOSFETs are never on at the same time, which minimizes the quiescent current and thereby the power
                        losses. The goal of this project was to design, simulate and construct a half-bridge class D audio
                        amplifier. A working amplifier with 80 % efficiency was built, with power losses occuring mainly
                        in the voltage regulators. Simulations of the amplifier corresponded well with the constructed amplifier
                        apart from issues originating from the aforementioned voltage regulation as well as the triangle
                        wave generator. The goal of the project was achieved and the finished amplifier possessed good sound
                        quality and little unwanted noise. To further improve on the design, better voltage regulation, a
                        full-bridge configuration and a feedback loop could be utilized.
