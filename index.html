            <h2>Summary of our thesis</h2>
            <p>
                Usage of class D audio amplifiers has become increasingly widespread in recent years, mainly due to their high efficiency,
                which can reach almost 100 %. Class D amplifiers can also be compact, making them suitable for mobile applications.
                In contrast, the most efficient conventional amplifiers such as class B can reach a maximum efficiency of
                78.5 %. The high efficiency of class D amplifiers can be attributed to the switching stage, which in the
                case of a half-bridge design consists of two amplifying MOSFETs. These MOSFETs are never on at the same time,
                which minimizes the quiescent current and thereby the power losses. The goal of this project was to design,
                simulate and construct a half-bridge class D audio amplifier. A working amplifier with 80 % efficiency was
                built, with power losses occuring mainly in the voltage regulators. Simulations of the amplifier corresponded
                well with the constructed amplifier apart from issues originating from the aforementioned voltage regulation
                as well as the triangle wave generator. The goal of the project was achieved and the finished amplifier possessed
                good sound quality and little unwanted noise. To further improve on the design, better voltage regulation,
                a full-bridge configuration and a feedback loop could be utilized.
